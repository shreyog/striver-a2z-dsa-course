#### Snippets

1. **User Input / Output**

>    int a;

>    cout<<"Enter a number: "<<endl;

>    cin>>a;

>    cout<<"Number that you have entered: "<<a;

2. **Data Types**
  
  1. Primitive
  - integral (int, char)
  - bool
  - floating point (float, double)

  2. User defined
  - enum
  - structure
  - union
  - class

  3. Derived
  - array
  - pointer
  - reference

  > **Modifiers**: (long, unsigned)

  > unsigned int -> data types positive range becomes double to 65k there's no negative range.

  > long int -> data types byte size increases.
