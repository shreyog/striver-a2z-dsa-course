#### Snippets

1. **User Input / Output**

>>>
    int a;
    cout<<"Enter a number: "<<endl;
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"Number that you have entered: "<<a;
>>>

2. **Data Types**
  
    1. Primitive
    - integral (int, char)
    - bool
    - floating point (float, double)

    2. User defined
    - enum
    - structure
    - union
    - class

    3. Derived
    - array
    - pointer
    - reference

>>>
    **Modifiers**: (long, unsigned)
    unsigned int -> data types positive range becomes double to 65k there's no negative range.
    long int -> data types byte size increases.
